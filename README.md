### Abstract
The unprecedented rate of scientific publications is a major threat to the productivity of knowledge workers, who rely on scrutinizing the latest scientific discoveries for their daily tasks. In this dissertation, we introduce a Personal Research Agent that can help scientists in discovering, reading and learning from scientific documents, primarily in the computer science domain. We demonstrate how a confluence of techniques from the Natural Language Processing and Semantic Web domains can construct a knowledge base of semantically-rich, inter-connected graph of scholarly artifacts, effectively transforming scientific literature from written content in isolation, into a queryable web of knowledge, suitable for machine interpretation.
